<a name="l10"><span class="ln">10   </span></a>
<a name="l11"><span class="ln">11   </span></a><span class="s2">A kindly cat owner has installed a cat shelter in his garden. This acts </span>
<a name="l12"><span class="ln">12   </span></a><span class="s2">as a refuge for his feline friend should the creature be caught outside in </span>
<a name="l13"><span class="ln">13   </span></a><span class="s2">inclement weather at a time when its human servant is unavailable to open the </span>
<a name="l14"><span class="ln">14   </span></a><span class="s2">back door.</span>
<a name="l15"><span class="ln">15   </span></a>
<a name="l16"><span class="ln">16   </span></a><span class="s2">The cat shelter contains a small camera, along with a motion detector and an </span>
<a name="l17"><span class="ln">17   </span></a><span class="s2">RFID reader that detects a chip in a tag attached to the cat's collar. This </span>
<a name="l18"><span class="ln">18   </span></a><span class="s2">is connected via WiFi to a laptop in the house, where a program creates a log of </span>
<a name="l19"><span class="ln">19   </span></a><span class="s2">when the cat enters and leaves the shelter. If the chip is not detected, but </span>
<a name="l20"><span class="ln">20   </span></a><span class="s2">motion is, it can be assumed that the neighbour's cat has trespassed into the </span>
<a name="l21"><span class="ln">21   </span></a><span class="s2">shelter. In this case, a loud siren plays automatically, and jets of ice cold </span>
<a name="l22"><span class="ln">22   </span></a><span class="s2">water are directed at the intruder. The ferocity of the attack is such that </span>
<a name="l23"><span class="ln">23   </span></a><span class="s2">the cat can be assumed to have stayed for just one minute.</span>
<a name="l24"><span class="ln">24   </span></a>
<a name="l25"><span class="ln">25   </span></a><span class="s2">There has been a significant investment in this project, and the cat owner </span>
<a name="l26"><span class="ln">26   </span></a><span class="s2">is keen to find out how much the shelter is being used. A program to analyse a </span>
<a name="l27"><span class="ln">27   </span></a><span class="s2">daily log file is required.</span>
<a name="l28"><span class="ln">28   </span></a>
<a name="l29"><span class="ln">29   </span></a><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Detailed Specification</span>
<a name="l30"><span class="ln">30   </span></a>
<a name="l31"><span class="ln">31   </span></a><span class="s2">The laptop stores a data stream in a file that can be analysed. It records when a </span>
<a name="l32"><span class="ln">32   </span></a><span class="s2">cat entered, when it left, and whether the cat was an intruder. One line is written </span>
<a name="l33"><span class="ln">33   </span></a><span class="s2">for every cat activity, so a single line contains both the entry and departure times.</span>
<a name="l34"><span class="ln">34   </span></a>
<a name="l35"><span class="ln">35   </span></a><span class="s2">Times are stored as minutes, with a start of midnight. So midnight would be </span>
<a name="l36"><span class="ln">36   </span></a><span class="s2">represented as zero, 1am is 60, and 9</span><span class="s1">:</span><span class="s2">30am would be 570 </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">9 x 60 + 30</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">. There </span>
<a name="l37"><span class="ln">37   </span></a><span class="s2">is one file created each day.</span>
<a name="l38"><span class="ln">38   </span></a>
<a name="l39"><span class="ln">39   </span></a><span class="s2">The cat shelter is small, so there can only be one cat in it at a time. It is </span>
<a name="l40"><span class="ln">40   </span></a><span class="s2">often empty as the cat likes to bask on the roof.</span>
<a name="l41"><span class="ln">41   </span></a>
<a name="l42"><span class="ln">42   </span></a><span class="s2">The format of the file is shown by the following short sample.</span>

<a name="l44"><span class="ln">44   </span></a><span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">text</span>
