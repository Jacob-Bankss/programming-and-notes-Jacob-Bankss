> **AI Declaration:**  
> The 100 line code program, parts of the README, and the logbook notes were created with the assistance (not full creation) of generative AI (ChatGPT).
> AI was used to help me understand areas of the 'parts' 1-10 found in the logbook folder, as well as how I could make the file look more professional (layout).
> AI was used to help draft code and explanations. the idea for my project was purely mine, AI had no influence over my ability to choose what I wanted to do for this project.
> I have reviewed and tested all material to ensure I understand how the program works, and that it functions as it's meant to, and take full responsibility for the final submission, in line with Leeds Beckett University’s Principles for the use of Generative AI.
